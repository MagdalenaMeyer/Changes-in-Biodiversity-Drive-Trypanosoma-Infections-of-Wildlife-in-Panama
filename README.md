# Changes in Biodiversity Drive Trypanosoma Infections of Wildlife in Panama
Here we deposit the data presented in the upcoming research paper entitled "Changes in Biodiversity Drive Trypanosoma Infections of Wildlife in Panama"

We provide two datasets (Meyer_Dataset_Trypanosoma_Panama and Meyer_Dataset_Correlation_Trypanosoma_Panama), which form the backbone of the analysis performed in the associated R Markdown (Meyer_RScript_Trypanosoma_Panama).

Meyer_Dataset_Trypanosoma_Panama contains 14 columns containing the individual information of each individual animal as rows:

A. field_id (a unique identifier for each animal) B. capture_site (specific location where animals were trapped) C. species (taxonomic identity) D. infraclass (taxonomic rank below the subclass and above the order) E. season (specific period when fieldwork was conducted) F. landscape (the broader geographical and ecological area encompassing the capture sites) G. tryp_inf (binary presence/absence data for Trypanosoma infections) H. density_prse (density of Proechimys semispinosus) I. density_phop (density of Philander opossum) J. density_dima (density of Didelphis marsupialis) K. density_mars (density of marsupials) L. shannon (Shannon species diversity for each study site) M. tryp_prev (Trypanosoma prevalence per capture site) N. GenDiv (mean genetic diversity of Proechimys semispinosus per capture site)

Meyer_Dataset_Correlation_Trypanosoma_Panama contains 5 columns containing the overall information on Shannon species diversity and Trypanosoma prevalence across the study sites:

A. landscape (the broader geographical and ecological area encompassing the capture sites) B. Conservation status (indicates whether the area is under protection or not) C. capture_site (specific location where animals were trapped) D. SHA ((Shannon species diversity for per capture site) E. Tryp_Prev ((Trypanosoma prevalence per capture site)
